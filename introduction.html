       Gender ratio in government schools is an important aspect of education equity and social development. It reflects the proportion of boys to girls enrolled in schools and highlights the level of gender inclusivity in the education system. Analyzing the gender ratio helps in understanding whether both genders have equal access to education, identifying gaps, and addressing challenges such as dropout rates, lack of facilities, and societal barriers.

         Studying the gender ratio in government schools can provide valuable insights into existing disparities and help in promoting awareness about the importance of gender equality in education. A healthy gender ratio indicates balanced participation, but when the ratio is skewed—often with fewer girls in upper grades—it reveals systemic issues such as economic inequality, traditional gender roles, child marriage, safety concerns, or inadequate school infrastructure.
 Girls, particularly in rural and low-income communities, are disproportionately affected by challenges like the lack of proper sanitation, long travel distances to school, absence of female teachers, and family responsibilities. These factors contribute to higher dropout rates among girls, especially at the secondary level. Boys, too, may face pressure to drop out early to earn income for their families, indicating that both genders face unique educational barriers. Government schemes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, scholarships for girl children, and initiatives like the construction of separate toilets have helped improve enrollment and retention of girls in government schools.

        Education is a fundamental right for every child and plays a critical role in shaping the future of individuals and societies. Government schools, which are run and funded by the state, serve as a key platform for providing free and    
equitable education to children from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. One important aspect of educational equity is gender parity — ensuring that boys and girls have equal opportunities to enroll, attend, and succeed in school.

        The gender ratio in government schools refers to the numerical comparison between male and female students enrolled in these institutions. Studying this ratio is essential for understanding the progress made toward achieving gender equality in education, a goal emphasized in national policies and global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4 and SDG 5).

    <p style="font-size: medium;">
       Despite various initiatives such as the Right to Education Act (RTE), Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, and mid-day meal schemes, disparities in gender enrollment still exist in some regions due to factors such as:<br>
       •	Socio-cultural norms and gender biases<br>
•	Economic constraints in low-income households<br>
•	Early marriage or domestic responsibilities for girls<br>
•	Safety and hygiene concerns, especially for adolescent girls<br>
•	Lack of awareness about the importance of girls’ education<br>
Identifying and analyzing the gender ratio in government schools helps policymakers, educators, and social workers understand where interventions are needed. It also reveals patterns such as:<br>
•	Regional differences in gender enrollment<br>
•	Dropout rates by gender<br>
•	Attendance and academic performance disparities<br>
•	Impact of government schemes on gender parity<br>
